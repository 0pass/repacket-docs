title: Reusable Snippets
description: Reusable, custom snippets to keep content in sync
---

One of the core principles of software development is DRY (Don't Repeat
Yourself). This is a principle that we should apply to our documentation as
well. If you find yourself repeating the same content in multiple places, you
should consider creating a custom snippet to keep your content in sync.

## Creating a custom snippet

1. Create a new file in the `snippets` directory.

<Note>
  Any page in the `snippets` directory will be treated as a snippet and will not
  be rendered into a standalone page.
</Note>

### Default export

2. Add content to your snippet file that you want to reuse across multiple
   locations.

```md snippets/my-snippet.mdx
Hello world! This is my content I want to reuse across pages.

## Header 2

`code`

<div>I <3 MDX</div>
```

<Warning>
  The content that you want to reuse must be inside the `snippets` directory in
  order for the import to work.
</Warning>

3. Import the snippet into your destination file.

```md destination-file.mdx
---
title: My title
description: My Description
---

import MySnippet from '/snippets/path/to/my-snippet.mdx';

## Header

Lorem impsum dolor sit amet.

<MySnippet />
```

### Reusable components

2. Inside your snippet file, create a component that takes in props by exporting
   your component in the form of an arrow function.

```md snippets/custom-component.mdx
export const MyComponent = ({ title }) => (

  <div>
    <h1>{title}</h1>
    <p>... snippet content ...</p>
  </div>
);
```

<Warning>
  MDX does not compile inside the body of an arrow function. Stick to HTML
  syntax when you can.
</Warning>

3. import the snippet into your destination file and pass in the props

   :

```md destination-file.mdx
---
title: My title
description: My Description
---

import { MyComponent } from "../path/to/custom-component.mdx";

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.

<MyComponent title={"Custom title"} />
```

### Reusable variables

2. Export a variable from your snippet file:

```md custom-variables.mdx
---
snippet: true
---

export const myName = "my name";

export const myObject = { fruit: "strawberries" };
```

3. Import the snippet from your destination file and use the variable:

```md destination-file.mdx
---
title: My title
description: My Description
---

import { myName, myObject } from "../path/to/custom-variables.mdx";

Hello, my name is {myName} and I like {myObject.fruit}.
```
