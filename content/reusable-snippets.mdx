title: Reusable Snippets
description: Reusable, custom snippets to keep content in sync
---

One of the core principles of software development is DRY (Don't Repeat
Yourself). This is a principle that we should apply to our documentation as
well. If you find yourself repeating the same content in multiple places, you
should consider creating a custom snippet to keep your content in sync.

## Creating a custom snippet

Create a new file and add `snippet: true` to the frontmatter.

```md my-snippet.mdx
---
snippet: true
---

... snippet content ...
```

<Note>
  For any export from a file to work you must prepend the file with the
  `snippet: true` frontmatter. Additionally, adding the `snippet` frontmatter
  will prevent the file from being rendered as a standalone page.
</Note>

## Using a custom snippet

### Default import

1. Import the snippet at the top of the file:

```md destination-file.mdx
---
title: My title
description: My Description
---

import MySnippet from '../path/to/my-snippet.mdx';

## Header

Lorem impsum dolor sit amet.

<MySnippet />
```

### Reusable components

In order to create a component that takes in props you must export an arrow
function from your snippet file.

```md custom-component.mdx
---
snippet: true
---

export const MyComponent = ({ title }) => (

  <div>
    <h1>{title}</h1>
    <p>... snippet content ...</p>
  </div>
);
```

<Warning>
  Complex MDX does not work well inside the body of an arrow function. Stick to
  HTML syntax when you can.
</Warning>

Then import the snippet from your destination file and pass in the props:

```md destination-file.mdx
---
title: My title
description: My Description
---

import { MyComponent } from "../path/to/custom-component.mdx";

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.

<MyComponent title={"Custom title"} />
```

### Reusable variables

In order to create a variable that can be used in multiple places you must
export it from a snippet file.

```md custom-variables.mdx
---
snippet: true
---

export const myName = "my name";

export const myObject = { fruit: "strawberries" };
```

Then import the snippet from your destination file and use the variable:

```md destination-file.mdx
---
title: My title
description: My Description
---

import { myName, myObject } from "../path/to/custom-variables.mdx";

Hello, my name is {myName} and I like {myObject.fruit}.
```
