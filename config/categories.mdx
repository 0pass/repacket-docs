To simplify configuration, domains are grouped into categories. Categories can contain list of domains, or wildcard domains (i.e. *.google.com).

A website may be in more than one category.

## Custom Categories

You can also define your own custom categories to use in other rules. This allows you to easily group internal domains together, such as to disable some or all protection features on them.

Custom categories can contain:
 - Literal domains, i.e. www.google.com
 - Wildcard domains, like *.google.com

Domains starting with a `-` are removed from the category rather than being added. For example, by adding `*.google.com` and `-maps.google.com`, the category will include google.com and its subdomains, but not maps.google.com. Additions and subtractions are applied in order, so the `-` domain must come after the wildcard domain.

## Overriding built-in categories

Find a domain that's miscategorized? You can override default categories - both to add a domain to a category or to remove the domain from it.
