## Overview of PHI AI Analysis

The Data Loss Prevention (DLP) feature provides advanced controls to safeguard sensitive data, particularly in the context of healthcare and other industries where privacy is crucial. One of the key DLP features is PHI AI Analysis, designed to detect and manage Protected Health Information (PHI) for AI prompts that include text or uploads. This AI-powered feature is highly configurable, enabling organizations to protect sensitive data while maintaining operational flexibility.


## Configuring DLP Rules

// TODO: add dlp-rule-edit.png

## Filtering Options

DLP rules can be applied across different filtering entities, including **domains**, **categories**, **applications**

## Customizing the Analysis Type

Within each rule, administrators can specify how to conduct analysis:

1. Text Analysis: Focuses on scanning text data.
2. Upload Analysis: Targets file uploads, ensuring that sensitive data is not inadvertently shared through document uploads.
3. Text & Uploads: A comprehensive setting that scans both textual content and file uploads.

This allows admins to tailor the analysis according to the specific nature of the data flow within their organization.

## Additional Settings

DLP configuration comes with various additional settings to enhance security and flexibility:

1. Generate alerts upon positive analysis: When enabled, the system will generate an alert whenever a particular sensitive data type (PHI, PII, PCI, etc.) is detected in any entity monitored by the rule. This can be useful for audit and compliance purposes.
2. Analyze on all uploads: This setting enables the system to scan all uploads for sensitive data types, even if they do not fall under the selected domains or categories. It is an aggressive safeguard, ensuring no sensitive data is missed.
3. Action upon detection: Administrators can configure what happens when a sensitive data type is detected. Actions may include:
    1. Block: Completely block the request where sensitive data was included.
    2. Warn: Notify the user of potential risks and allow them to decide whether to proceed.

## Exclusions

// TODO: add dlp-exclusions.png

To accommodate specific business needs or regulatory requirements, our DLP feature allows administrators to create exclusions. These exclusions can be applied to particular domains, categories, or even IP ranges using CIDR notation (both IPv4 and IPv6). These exclusions get applied to all DLP analysis types.

For example, an internal domain (internal.company.com) can be excluded from DLP rules to allow for operational freedom while maintaining security for external domains.

### Steps to Edit or Create an Exception:

// TODO: add dlp-exclusion-new.png

1. Navigate to the Data Loss Prevention module.
2. Click edit exclusions
3. Alias the exclusion for future reference
4. Add the domain, category, or IP range you wish to exclude from the DLP rules.
5. Click the add button
6. Save your changes 

By configuring these exceptions, organizations can ensure that critical workflows are not hindered by overly strict security measures.
