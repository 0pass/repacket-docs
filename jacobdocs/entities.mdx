## What are entities?

Entities represent the key targets for applying security and policy features within Repacket. They encompass a wide range of definable objects such as **categories**, **domains**, **IP ranges**, and **applications**. Configuration of most features in Repacket requires specification of what entities to target.

Entities allow for flexible & targeted controls, enabling you to shape the behavior of the system according to organizational security needs. For example, you can: apply content filtering policies to entire categories, apply **Phishing Protection** to specific domains, exclude certain features from being used on your internal websites, and much more using entities. This level of flexibility ensures that your network and data remain secure.

## Entity types

### Domains

Domains can be used to apply controls in a more granular fashion. They are mainly used within **modules** like **Phishing Protection** and **DLP**.

### Categories

Categories encompass a set of domains, and can be used to apply controls broadly. They function in the same way that domains do, you can apply them to **modules** and **content filtering**. Repacket provides a large range of categories by default. You can also create custom **categories** and apply a set of domains to said category, allowing you to easily target multiple domains with a feature quickly.

### IP Ranges

IP ranges function using CIDR notation and are used to mainly exclude your internal websites from Repacket features.

### Applications

Applications are specifically used for PHI AI Analysis, within the **DLP** module. You can target specific AI websites like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini.
