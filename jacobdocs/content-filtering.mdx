## Overview of Content Filtering

Content Filtering allows administrators to control internet access by applying rules to different categories, domains, and user groups. This is a core feature, providing precise control over what web resources can be accessed.

It operates by organizing internet resources into categories. These categories can either be default (pre-configured by Repacket) or custom (created by the admin). Admins can set up rules—such as Allow, Block, or Warn—that dictate how the system handles requests to access web pages in each category.

In addition, Repacket allows the configuration of exceptions for specific users or groups. This adds flexibility, ensuring certain users or departments can bypass restrictions when needed, without compromising the network’s security.

### Default Categories

Repacket provides a large range of built-in categories for you to filter content on.

Examples below:

Real Estate: Websites related to buying, selling, or renting property.
Computer and Internet Security: Resources focused on cybersecurity practices.
Financial Services: Websites related to banking, insurance, and financial investments.
Business and Economy: Business-related websites including corporate websites and economic information.
Auctions, Shopping, Travel, etc.: Other frequently encountered categories.

## Custom Categories

Admins can also create custom categories that reflect the unique needs of their organization. For example, if you would like to whitelist some - but not all social media platforms specifically for your marketing team, you could create a custom category "Marketing Social Media" and set it to block, but add an exception for the marketing group.

### Creating a Custom Category

// TODO: category-creation.png

1. Navigate to the Custom tab under Content Filtering.
2. Click the Create button
3. Name the category (e.g., "Marketing social media").
4. Add the relevant domains (e.g., instagram.com, x.com, reddit.com).
5. Save your changes
6. Set the content filtering rule to "Allow", "Block", "Warn"
7. Create any necessary exceptions

## Rule Types

// TODO: Add block/warning page examples

For both default and custom categories, admins can choose from the following rules:

Allow: Users can access the websites in the category without restriction.
Block: Access is fully restricted. Users will see a block page if they attempt to visit the sites.
Warn: Users are warned about the risks of accessing the page but are still given the option to proceed.

This flexibility ensures that administrators can balance security with productivity, tailoring rules based on the category's risk profile.

## User and Group Exceptions

// TODO: category-exception.png

Exceptions can be made for individual users or groups who may need special access. For example, a member of the Sales team might need access to certain websites in the "Gambling" category for fantasy sports, even if the rule is generally set to "Block."

### Creating an Exception:

1. Select a category (default or custom) from the Categories menu.
2. In the right panel, click the New Exception button.
3. Specify the user or group (e.g., John Doe, Admin Accounts).
4. Set the rule for this exception (Allow, Block, Warn).
5. Save your changes

This exception system provides a fine-tuned control over internet access, allowing companies to manage access without blanket restrictions that can hinder productivity.
